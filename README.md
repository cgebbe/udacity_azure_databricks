# About

This repository contains my notes for the ["Data lakes and Lakehouses with Spark and Azure Databricks"](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-lakes-and-lakehouses-with-spark-and-azure-databricks--cd11531) course by Udacity.

## Certificate

I went through all video contents within a few hours, but then cancelled my subscription to get a refund because the course content and project was very similar to the ones of the [Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree I had completed](https://github.com/cgebbe/udacity_data_engineers) earlier this year.
